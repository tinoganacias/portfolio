# portfolio


the following code displays the start of my portfolio page.  It includes my name, contact info, and place holders for my work.  when clicking on links in the nav bar, you will be taken to the corresponding section on the site (excluding resume).  The team logos are placeholders for my dev work and the footer includes links to my contact and social info.

this is a great house frame for my dev portfolio.

thank you.
